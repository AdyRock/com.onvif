This app supports cameras that comply with the ONVIF S and T profiles.

The app has the following features:
* Current snapshot.

Plus, if the camera supports motion detection:
* Motion alert with flow trigger,
* Motion snapshot.
* Delay between motion detection and snapshot.
* Single or multiple alerts while motion triggered.
* Enable / disable motion detection.

An image is captured when a motion alert is generated and can be viewed in the device as well as a 'live' snapshot image.
Those images can also be accessed by flow tags to be sent to other devices by action cards.

This app uses a modified version of the onvif library found here https://github.com/agsh/onvif
