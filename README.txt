This app supports cameras that comply with the ONVIF S and T profiles.

View the current snapshot image if the camera supports a JPG image.

Plus, if the camera supports a compatible motion detection method, you can:
* Get a motion alert with a flow trigger,
* Get a motion snapshot image if the camera supports a JPG image.
* Set the delay between motion detection and snapshot.
* Enable single or multiple alerts while motion triggered.
* You can also enable and disable motion detection.

An image is captured when a motion alert is generated and can be viewed in the device as well as a 'live' snapshot image that is refreshed at will.
Those images can also be accessed by flow tags to be sent to other devices by action cards.
